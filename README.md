# Gromov-Wasserstein Distance for Reeb Graphs

This repository implements the Gromov-Wasserstein distance (GW) for comparing Reeb graphsã€‚ This method integrates topological and geometric features of Reeb graphs, providing a robust framework for their comparison. Key innovations include the Symmetric-Reeb radius and persistence diagram-based Borel probabilities.

## Overview

Reeb graphs represent the topological evolution of scalar fields. Traditional comparison metrics are often computationally intensive or fail to capture significant features. Our RGWp-based approach offers:

- **Symmetric-Reeb Radius**: Resolves asymmetry issues in traditional metrics.
- **Persistence Diagram-Based Probabilities**: Focuses on topologically critical features.
- **Polynomial Time Complexity**: Suitable for large-scale applications.

### Workflow

1. Compute the Symmetric-Reeb radius between nodes.
2. Assign persistence diagram-based Borel probabilities.
3. Calculate the optimal transport plan and RGWp distance.
